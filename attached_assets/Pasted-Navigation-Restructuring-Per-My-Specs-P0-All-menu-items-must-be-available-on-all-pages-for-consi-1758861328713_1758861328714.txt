Navigation Restructuring (Per My Specs)

P0. All menu items must be available on all pages for consistency
1. home → revert to the professional home with both incluu and Dr. Dédé information.
1a. use a blend of the color from https://replit.com/@admin3035/incluu, https://replit.com/@admin3035/dr-dede
2. incluu → use incluu.vrcel.app. Merge or integrate the reverted AI Governance & Strategic Consulting page into existing https://incluu.vrcel.app/
2.1 Integrate hero image and current temporary incluu site (https://yellow-giraffe-8pwk.squarespace.com/) into https://replit.com/@admin3035/incluu and into https://replit.com/@admin3035/incluu-static
2a. Move the case studies from https://replit.com/@admin3035/incluu to incluu submenu "Case Studies"
2b. Move the "Case Studies" from https://replit.com/@admin3035/dr-dede to incluu submenu "Testimonials"
2c. Direct "About Dr. Dédé" to https://dr-dede.vercel.app/
2d. Add "Blog" menu item and direct to: https://www.incluu.us/blog (the same exists on Dr. Dédé so I want to be consistent)
2e. Add "Resources" menu item and direct to" https://dr-dede.vercel.app/ (the same exists on Dr. Dédé so I want to be consistent)
3. Dr. Dédé → use https://replit.com/@admin3035/dr-dede; integrate the hero images on each page of https://www.dr-dede.com/ into Dr. Dédé
3a. Dr. Dédé submenus:
Change current menu text "Executive Retreats" → "Retreats & Advocacy". Revert page content back to "Executive Retreats" content.
3a-1. In "Retreats & Advocacy", add section on Luxury Wellness, and add a link to the Rest as Resistance Retreat (rar.dr-dede.com), as one of the current offerings (of many upcoming retreats)
3a-2. In "Retreats & Advocacy", add section on Disability Advocacy and create Disability Advocacy page (not redirect to dr-dede.com)
3a-3. Remove "Visit Dr. Dédé's Site" from "Retreats & Advocacy"
3b. Change current menu text "Speaking Topics" → "Speaking & Events", and revert the page contents back to "Speaking Topics"
3c. Direct "incluu" menu to https://incluu.vercel.app/
3d. Add "
4. Remove "Contact" from menu, since we will still have "Contact →"
4a. "Contact →" → merge "Contact + Book a Call" into one, revert to the previous Contact page contents
5. Change any mentions of "Dr. Dédé Wilson" to "Dr. Dédé Tetsubayashi"
6. Replace https://dr-dede-tedx-homepage.vercel.app/ with https://nslacnow.manus.space/ because Replit has been unable to add my photos, so I can't send people to the site.

Page Modifications
- Wellness Programs → rename to "Luxury Wellness" with rar.dr-dede.com submenu
- Create Disability Advocacy page (not redirect to dr-dede.com)
Watch TEDx → redirect to https://dr-dede-tedx-homepage.vercel.app/
Brand Color Fixes
Extract correct colors from https://replit.com/@admin3035/incluu, https://replit.com/@admin3035/dr-dede
(if more helpful, use https://dr-dede.vercel.app/ and https://incluu.vercel.app/)
- Fix illegible dr-dede menu/button colors
- Fix too-bright incluu cyan
- Remove Dr. Dédé color-changing widget
Content Strategy
- Use existing materials from your Vercel/Replit pages
- Merge/update rather than recreate
- Only avoid using photos of people who aren't Dr. Dédé
